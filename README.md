# PocketMan

General purpose Pocket PC program.

Currently only the AudioPlayer tab works, somewhat.

## Contributing

To build this program you will preferably use Visual Studio 2008 with the built-in emulator _(USA Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket PC R2 Emulator)_ since debugging on a physical device can be troublesome.
